## how much time to give each point?
> following points can be changed
* after 1st group meeting on 2nd of january we will have 13 days. 

* since research takes time so we will not wait for metting research on your own till meeting and hone your skills(learn fast we dont have much time) after meeting we will decide if we need more research.

* planning will be on either first meeting or we will call second meeting as required. take 1 or 2 days

* design in one day shouldnt take time after research.

* creative ideas come randomly cant take account of that.

* after all of these we will roughly have 12 days for development ,(we have to make what we designed exactly not more not less ) try to finish in 10 days . more after planning.
